    "text": "It is not fully understood how the phase waves of the segmentation clock are initially established (Falk et al. 2022). To identify the genetic basis of these phase waves, our collaborators Ali Seleit and Alexander Aulehla at EMBL-Heidelberg used a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in approach (Seleit, Aulehla, and Paix 2021) to establish a medaka Cab strain with an endogenous, fluorescing reporter gene (Her7-Venus) for the oscillation signalling pathway. This method allows them to image somite formation and extract quantitative measures for segmentation clock dynamics. They determined that the southern Japanese Cab strain and the northern Japanese Kaga strain have divergent somite periodicity, where Kaga’s tends to be faster, and Cab’s slower (Figure 1.1), and selected them as the parental strains in an F2-cross. This chapter sets out my bioinformatic contributions to the project by identifying the genetic variations associated with differences in somite periodicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Comparison of period for three inbred medaka strains (Cab, Kaga and HdrR).

As the measure is simply based on the total number of pixels covered by the embryo object, I considered it to be potentially more robust than the period measurements, and therefore included it as a type of positive control for the genetic association analyses on the period phenotype. The measurements for PSM area comparing F0 Cab and Kaga strains are shown in fig-ali-psm-f0.\nMeasurements of unsegmented PSM area in pixels for the F0 individuals from the Cab strain (\\(N = 19\\)) and Kaga strain (\\(N = 10\\)).

    "text": "2.3 Comparisons between F0, F1 and F2 generations\nfig-somite-phenos shows the distributions of the period intercept and unsegmented PSM area phenotypes across the F0, F1 and F2 generations. In relation to the period intercept phenotype, only the Cab strain in shown for F0 because only the Cab strain carries the reporter gene, which prohibited the collection of data for Kaga using this pyBOAT method. However, from previous bright field image analyses (which did not require the reporter), my collaborators determined that the Kaga strain has a lower (i.e. faster) period than Cab by around 10 minutes (see Figure @ref(fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR) in the Introduction). Given these differences, the F1 generation shows the expected intermediate median between the Cab and Kaga F0 strains. I also expected to observe that the F2 generation has a similar median to the F1 generation, but with a wider variance that spans across the extremes of the two F0 parental strains. Instead, I observed that the F2 generation has a median that is slightly slower than the median of the slower-period F0 Cab strain. My collaborators assured me that these observations were unlikely to be caused by technical issues. A possible biological explanation of this is that there are more genetic combinations that slow down the clock rather than speed it up (sanchezArnoldTongueEntrainment2022?; schroterSegmentNumberAxial2010?). This phenomenon could be exacerbated by the fact that the Cab and Kaga strains originate from different Japanese medaka populations (southern and northern respectively), which are understood to be at the point of speciation (see Chapter @ref(MIKK-genomes-chap)), so this slower period may be driven by a biological incompatibility between their genomes in cases where they do not have a complete chromosome from each parent (as the F1 generation does). I nevertheless proceeded with the genetic analysis with a view to potentially discovering the reason for this unusual distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Comparisons between the F0, F1 and F2 generations for period intercept and unsegmented PSM area. As only the Cab strain contains the reporter gene, the F0 only shows period intercept for Cab individuals (with the Kaga strain previously estimated to have a period of ~10 minutes slower than Cab). A: period intercept in minutes. B: unsegmented PSM area in pixels. \\(P\\)-values are derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing the F2 individuals across microscopes. For unsegmented PSM area, data was only collected for the F2 generation.\n\n\n\n\nAnother important issue to note is that the F2 individuals were sequenced using different microscopes of the same model (Zeiss LSM 780) but with different temperature control units and incubator boxes, denoted as ‘AU’ and ‘DB’.1 Our collaborators noticed that there was a difference between the microscopes in their temperatures of 0.7-0.8°C, translating to a 4-minute difference in the F2 means for the period intercept measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 177.97, \\(p\\) = 1.34 x 10-40), and a 3.5-minute difference in the F2 means for the period mean measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 141.79, \\(p\\) = 1.08 x 10-32). This difference would need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis through either adjusting the phenotype prior to running the genetic association model, or by including microscope as a covariate in the model. For unsegmentated PSM area, I did not find a significant difference between microscopes, so I determined that it was not necessary to control for microscope in the downstream analysis for this phenotype.\n\n2.3.0.1 Inverse-normalisation\nTo resolve this difference between microscopes for the period intercept data, I elected to transform it for the F2 generation by “inverse-normalising” the period intercept within each microscope (Figure @ref(fig:invnorm-intercept)), and used this transformed phenotype for the downstream analysis. Inverse-normalisation is a rank-based normalisation approach which involves replacing the values in the phenotype vector with their rank (where ties are averaged), then converting the ranks into a normal distribution with the quantile function (wichuraAlgorithm241Percentage1988?). The inverse-normalisation function I used for this analysis is set out in the following R code:"
