    "text": "It is not fully understood how the phase waves of the segmentation clock are initially established (Falk et al. 2022). To identify the genetic basis of these phase waves, our collaborators Ali Seleit and Alexander Aulehla at EMBL-Heidelberg used a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in approach (Seleit, Aulehla, and Paix 2021) to establish a medaka Cab strain with an endogenous, fluorescing reporter gene (Her7-Venus) for the oscillation signalling pathway. This method allows them to image somite formation and extract quantitative measures for segmentation clock dynamics. They determined that the southern Japanese Cab strain and the northern Japanese Kaga strain have divergent somite periodicity, where Kaga’s tends to be faster, and Cab’s slower (Figure 1.1), and selected them as the parental strains in an F2-cross. This chapter sets out my bioinformatic contributions to the project by identifying the genetic variations associated with differences in somite periodicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Comparison of period for three inbred medaka strains (Cab, Kaga and HdrR).

    "text": "2.3 Comparisons between F0, F1 and F2 generations\nFigure 2.4 shows the distributions of the period intercept and unsegmented PSM area phenotypes across the F0, F1 and F2 generations. In relation to the period intercept phenotype, only the Cab strain in shown for F0 because only the Cab strain carries the reporter gene, which prohibited the collection of data for Kaga using this pyBOAT method. However, from previous bright field image analyses (which did not require the reporter), my collaborators determined that the Kaga strain has a lower (i.e. faster) period than Cab by around 10 minutes (see Figure @ref(fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR) in the Introduction). Given these differences, the F1 generation shows the expected intermediate median between the Cab and Kaga F0 strains. I also expected to observe that the F2 generation has a similar median to the F1 generation, but with a wider variance that spans across the extremes of the two F0 parental strains. Instead, I observed that the F2 generation has a median that is slightly slower than the median of the slower-period F0 Cab strain. My collaborators assured me that these observations were unlikely to be caused by technical issues. A possible biological explanation of this is that there are more genetic combinations that slow down the clock rather than speed it up (Sanchez et al. 2022; Schröter and Oates 2010). This phenomenon could be exacerbated by the fact that the Cab and Kaga strains originate from different Japanese medaka populations (southern and northern respectively), which are understood to be at the point of speciation (see Chapter @ref(MIKK-genomes-chap)), so this slower period may be driven by a biological incompatibility between their genomes in cases where they do not have a complete chromosome from each parent (as the F1 generation does). I nevertheless proceeded with the genetic analysis with a view to potentially discovering the reason for this unusual distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Comparisons between the F0, F1 and F2 generations for period intercept and unsegmented PSM area. As only the Cab strain contains the reporter gene, the F0 only shows period intercept for Cab individuals (with the Kaga strain previously estimated to have a period of ~10 minutes slower than Cab). A: period intercept in minutes. B: unsegmented PSM area in pixels. \\(P\\)-values are derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing the F2 individuals across microscopes. For unsegmented PSM area, data was only collected for the F2 generation.\n\n\n\n\nAnother important issue to note is that the F2 individuals were sequenced using different microscopes of the same model (Zeiss LSM 780) but with different temperature control units and incubator boxes, denoted as ‘AU’ and ‘DB’.1 Our collaborators noticed that there was a difference between the microscopes in their temperatures of 0.7-0.8°C, translating to a 4-minute difference in the F2 means for the period intercept measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 177.97, \\(p\\) = 1.34 x 10-40), and a 3.5-minute difference in the F2 means for the period mean measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 141.79, \\(p\\) = 1.08 x 10-32). This difference would need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis through either adjusting the phenotype prior to running the genetic association model, or by including microscope as a covariate in the model. For unsegmentated PSM area, I did not find a significant difference between microscopes, so I determined that it was not necessary to control for microscope in the downstream analysis for this phenotype.\n\n2.3.0.1 Inverse-normalisation\nTo resolve this difference between microscopes for the period intercept data, I elected to transform it for the F2 generation by “inverse-normalising” the period intercept within each microscope (Figure 2.5), and used this transformed phenotype for the downstream analysis. Inverse-normalisation is a rank-based normalisation approach which involves replacing the values in the phenotype vector with their rank (where ties are averaged), then converting the ranks into a normal distribution with the quantile function (Wichura 1988). The inverse-normalisation function I used for this analysis is set out in the following R code:\n\ninvnorm = function(x) {\n  res = rank(x)\n  # The arbitrary 0.5 value is added to the denominator below \n  # to avoid `qnorm()` returning 'Inf' for the last-ranked value\n  res = qnorm(res/(length(res)+0.5))\n  return(res)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Comparison of the period intercept phenotype data for the F2 generation before (A) and after (B) inverse-normalisation, with vertical lines marking the mean of each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanchez, Paul Gerald Layague, Victoria Mochulska, Christian Mauffette Denis, Gregor Mönke, Takehito Tomita, Nobuko Tsuchida-Straeten, Yvonne Petersen, Katharina F.

    "text": "3.2 F0 homozygosity\nBefore proceeding to map the F2 sequences to the genotypes of the F0 generation, I first investigated the levels of homozygosity in the F0 Cab and Kaga strains, as this would affect our ability to accurately call the F2 generation. That is to say, for regions where either F0 parent is consistently heterozygous, it would be difficult to determine the parent from which a particular F2 individual derived its chromosomes at that locus. I therefore aligned the high-coverage sequencing data for the F0 Cab and Kaga strains to the medaka HdrR reference (Ensembl release 104, build ASM223467v1) using BWA-MEM2 (Vasimuddin et al. 2019), sorted the aligned .sam files, marked duplicate reads, and merged the paired reads with picard (“Picard Toolkit” 2019), and indexed the .bam files with SAMtools (Li et al. 2009).\nTo call variants, I followed the GATK best practices (to the extent they were applicable) (McKenna et al. 2010; DePristo et al. 2011; Van der Auwera and O’Connor 2020) with GATK’s HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs tools (Poplin et al. 2018), then merged all calls into a single .vcf file with picard (“Picard Toolkit” 2019). Finally, I extracted the biallelic calls for Cab and Kaga with bcftools (Danecek et al. 2021), counted the number of SNPs within non-overlapping, 5-kb bins, and calculated the proportion of SNPs within each bin that were homozgyous.\nFigure @ref(fig:somite-f0-cab) is a circos plot generated with circlize (Gu et al. 2014) for the Cab F0 strain used in this experiment, featuring the proportion of homozygous SNPs per 5-kb bin (green), and the total number of SNPs in each bin (yellow). As expected for a strain that has been inbred for over 10 generations, the mean homozygosity for this strain is high, with a mean proportion of homozygosity across all bins of 83%.\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Cab F0 generation genome (green), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the levels of homozygosity in the Kaga strain used in this experiment was far lower, with a mean homozygosity across all bins of only 31% (Figure 3.2). This was a surprise, as it is an established strain that has been extant for decades, and we therefore expected the level of homozygosity to be commensurate with that observed in the Cab strain. An obvious exception is chr22, for which Kaga appears to be homozygous across its entire length.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Kaga F0 generation genome (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether the low levels of observed homozygosity in Kaga was affected by its alignments to the southern Japanese HdrR reference, we also aligned the F0 samples to the northern Japanese HNI reference (Figure 3.3). This did not make differences to the levels of observed homozygosity in either sample, which gave us confidence that the low homozygosity observed in Kaga was not driven by reference bias. I understand from our collaborators that the low homozygosity of this Kaga individual must have resulted from the strain having been contaminated at some stage by breeding with a different inbred strain prior to when they received the individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Kaga F0 generation genome when aligned to the HNI reference (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanecek, Petr, James K Bonfield, Jennifer Liddle, John Marshall, Valeriu Ohan, Martin O Pollard, Andrew Whitwham, et al. 2021. “Twelve Years of SAMtools and BCFtools.” GigaScience 10 (2): giab008. https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008.\n\n\nDePristo, Mark A., Eric Banks, Ryan Poplin, Kiran V.

The number of SNPs that met these criteria per chromosome are set out in Figure 4.2.
