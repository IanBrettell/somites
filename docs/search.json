    "text": "Somites are the earliest primitive segmental structures that form from presomatic mesoderm cells (PSM) in the embryo (Kim et al. 2011), later differentiating into vertebrae, ribs, and skeletal muscles. Somite formation occurs rhythmically and sequentially, with the time between the formation of each pair of somites referred to as the “period”. The period of somite formation varies greatly between species (Matsuda et al. 2020), and is controlled by a molecular oscillator, known as the ‘segmentation clock’, which drives waves of gene expression in developmental pathways.\nIt is not fully understood how the phase waves of the segmentation clock are initially established (Falk et al. 2022). To identify the genetic basis of these phase waves, our collaborators Ali Seleit and Alexander Aulehla at EMBL-Heidelberg used a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in approach (Seleit, Aulehla, and Paix 2021) to establish a medaka Cab strain with an endogenous, fluorescing reporter gene (Her7-Venus) for the oscillation signalling pathway. This method allows them to image somite formation and extract quantitative measures for segmentation clock dynamics. They determined that the southern Japanese Cab strain and the northern Japanese Kaga strain have divergent somite periodicity, where Kaga’s tends to be faster, and Cab’s slower (Figure 1.1), and selected them as the parental strains in an F2-cross. This chapter sets out my bioinformatic contributions to the project by identifying the genetic variations associated with differences in somite periodicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Comparison of period for three inbred medaka strains Cab, Kaga and HdrR.

    "text": "2.3 Comparisons between F0, F1 and F2 generations\nFigure 2.4 shows the distributions of the period intercept and unsegmented PSM area phenotypes across the F0, F1 and F2 generations. In relation to the period intercept phenotype, only the Cab strain in shown for F0 because only the Cab strain carries the reporter gene, which prohibited the collection of data for Kaga using this pyBOAT method. However, from previous bright field image analyses (which did not require the reporter), my collaborators determined that the Kaga strain has a lower (i.e. faster) period than Cab by around 10 minutes (see Figure @ref(fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR) in the Introduction). Given these differences, the F1 generation shows the expected intermediate median between the Cab and Kaga F0 strains. I also expected to observe that the F2 generation has a similar median to the F1 generation, but with a wider variance that spans across the extremes of the two F0 parental strains. Instead, I observed that the F2 generation has a median that is slightly slower than the median of the slower-period F0 Cab strain. My collaborators assured me that these observations were unlikely to be caused by technical issues. A possible biological explanation of this is that there are more genetic combinations that slow down the clock rather than speed it up (Sanchez et al. 2022; Schröter and Oates 2010). This phenomenon could be exacerbated by the fact that the Cab and Kaga strains originate from different Japanese medaka populations (southern and northern respectively), which are understood to be at the point of speciation (see Chapter @ref(MIKK-genomes-chap)), so this slower period may be driven by a biological incompatibility between their genomes in cases where they do not have a complete chromosome from each parent (as the F1 generation does). I nevertheless proceeded with the genetic analysis with a view to potentially discovering the reason for this unusual distribution.\n\n\nCode\nIN_F01 = here::here(\"data/F0_F1_period.xlsx\")\nIN_F2 = here::here(\"config/phenos_with_reporter_genoandpheno.csv\")\n\n########################\n# Plotting parameters\n########################\n\n# Intercept\nintercept_pal = c(\"#8D99AE\", \"#2b2d42\")\n\n# Mean\nmean_pal = c(\"#177E89\", \"#084C61\")\n\n# PSM\nunsegmented_psm_area_pal = c(\"#D9D0DE\", \"#401F3E\")\n\n# Get lighter/darker functions\n\ndevtools::source_gist(\"c5015ee666cdf8d9f7e25fa3c8063c99\")\n\n########################\n# Read in file\n########################\n\ndf_f2 = readr::read_delim(IN_F2, delim = \";\") %>% \n  #

For unsegmented PSM area, data was only collected for the F2 generation.\n\n\n\n\nAnother important issue to note is that the F2 individuals were sequenced using different microscopes of the same model (Zeiss LSM 780) but with different temperature control units and incubator boxes, denoted as ‘AU’ and ‘DB’.1 Our collaborators noticed that there was a difference between the microscopes in their temperatures of 0.7-0.8°C, translating to a 4-minute difference in the F2 means for the period intercept measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 177.97, \\(p\\) = 1.34 x 10-40), and a 3.5-minute difference in the F2 means for the period mean measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 141.79, \\(p\\) = 1.08 x 10-32). This difference would need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis through either adjusting the phenotype prior to running the genetic association model, or by including microscope as a covariate in the model. For unsegmentated PSM area, I did not find a significant difference between microscopes, so I determined that it was not necessary to control for microscope in the downstream analysis for this phenotype.\n\n2.3.0.1 Inverse-normalisation\nTo resolve this difference between microscopes for the period intercept data, I elected to transform it for the F2 generation by “inverse-normalising” the period intercept within each microscope (Figure 2.6), and used this transformed phenotype for the downstream analysis. Inverse-normalisation is a rank-based normalisation approach which involves replacing the values in the phenotype vector with their rank (where ties are averaged), then converting the ranks into a normal distribution with the quantile function (Wichura 1988). The inverse-normalisation function I used for this analysis is set out in the following R code:\n\n\nCode\ninvnorm = function(x) {\n  res = rank(x)\n  # The arbitrary 0.5 value is added to the denominator below \n  # to avoid `qnorm()` returning 'Inf' for the last-ranked value\n  res = qnorm(res/(length(res)+0.5))\n  return(res)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Set variables\n\n## Debug\nIN_F2 = here::here(\"config/phenos_with_reporter_genoandpheno.csv\")\nOUT_PNG = here::here(\"book/plots/phenotypes/invnorm_intercept.png\")\nOUT_PDF = here::here(\"book/plots/phenotypes/invnorm_intercept.pdf\")\n\n########################\n# Plotting parameters\n########################\n\n# Intercept\nintercept_pal = c(\"#8D99AE\", \"#2b2d42\")\n\n# Mean\nmean_pal = c(\"#177E89\", \"#084C61\")\n\n# PSM\nunsegmented_psm_area_pal = c(\"#D9D0DE\", \"#401F3E\")\n\n# Get lighter/darker functions\n\ndevtools::source_gist(\"c5015ee666cdf8d9f7e25fa3c8063c99\")\n\n########################\n# Read in file\n########################\n\ndf_f2 = readr::read_delim(IN_F2, delim = \";\") %>% \n  # add `GEN` column\n  dplyr::mutate(GEN = \"F2\") %>% \n  # factorise Microscope\n  dplyr::mutate(Microscope = factor(Microscope, levels = c(\"AU\", \"DB\")))\n\n# Get means per microscope\nf2_means_notrans = df_f2 %>% \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Microscope)) %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(Microscope) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(MEAN = mean(intercept, na.rm = T))\n\n\n########################\n# Plot\n########################\n\n########### Histogram raw\n\nraw_fig = df_f2 %>% \n  # remove NAs\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Microscope)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(intercept)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density.., fill = Microscope), bins = 40) +\n  geom_density(aes(colour = Microscope)) +\n  geom_vline(data = f2_means_notrans, aes(xintercept = MEAN)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = intercept_pal) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = darker(intercept_pal,amount = 75)) +\n  cowplot::theme_cowplot() + \n  facet_grid(rows = vars(GEN, Microscope)) +\n  xlab('period intercept') + \n  guides(fill = \"none\", colour = \"none\") +\n  labs(subtitle = \"original data\")\n\n########### Histogram inverse-normalised\n\ntrans_df = df_f2 %>% \n  # inverse-normalise within microscope\n  dplyr::group_by(Microscope) %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(intercept = invnorm(intercept)) %>% \n  dplyr::ungroup() %>% \n  # remove NAs\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Microscope))\n\n# Get means per microscope\nf2_means_trans = trans_df %>% \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Microscope)) %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(Microscope) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(MEAN = mean(intercept, na.rm = T))\n\ntrans_fig = trans_df %>% \n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(intercept)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density.., fill = Microscope), bins = 40) +\n  geom_density(aes(colour = Microscope)) +\n  geom_vline(data = f2_means_trans, aes(xintercept = MEAN)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = intercept_pal) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = darker(intercept_pal,amount = 75)) +\n  cowplot::theme_cowplot() + \n  facet_grid(rows = vars(GEN, Microscope)) +\n  xlab('period intercept (inverse-normalised)') + \n  guides(fill = \"none\", colour = \"none\") +\n  labs(subtitle = \"inverse-normalised within microscope\")\n\n\n########### Together\n\nfinal = cowplot::plot_grid(raw_fig,\n                                  trans_fig,\n                                  align = \"hv\",\n                                  nrow = 2,\n                                  labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"),\n                                  label_size = 16)\n\nfinal\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Comparison of the period intercept phenotype data for the F2 generation before (A) and after (B) inverse-normalisation, with vertical lines marking the mean of each group.

    "text": "3.2 F0 homozygosity\nBefore proceeding to map the F2 sequences to the genotypes of the F0 generation, I first investigated the levels of homozygosity in the F0 Cab and Kaga strains, as this would affect our ability to accurately call the F2 generation. That is to say, for regions where either F0 parent is consistently heterozygous, it would be difficult to determine the parent from which a particular F2 individual derived its chromosomes at that locus. I therefore aligned the high-coverage sequencing data for the F0 Cab and Kaga strains to the medaka HdrR reference (Ensembl release 104, build ASM223467v1) using BWA-MEM2 (Vasimuddin et al. 2019), sorted the aligned .sam files, marked duplicate reads, and merged the paired reads with picard (“Picard Toolkit” 2019), and indexed the .bam files with SAMtools (Li et al. 2009).\nTo call variants, I followed the GATK best practices (to the extent they were applicable) (McKenna et al. 2010; DePristo et al. 2011; Van der Auwera and O’Connor 2020) with GATK’s HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs tools (Poplin et al. 2018), then merged all calls into a single .vcf file with picard (“Picard Toolkit” 2019). Finally, I extracted the biallelic calls for Cab and Kaga with bcftools (Danecek et al. 2021), counted the number of SNPs within non-overlapping, 5-kb bins, and calculated the proportion of SNPs within each bin that were homozgyous.\nfig-somite-f0-cab is a circos plot generated with circlize (Gu et al. 2014) for the Cab F0 strain used in this experiment, featuring the proportion of homozygous SNPs per 5-kb bin (green), and the total number of SNPs in each bin (yellow). As expected for a strain that has been inbred for over 10 generations, the mean homozygosity for this strain is high, with a mean proportion of homozygosity across all bins of 83%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Cab F0 generation genome (green), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the levels of homozygosity in the Kaga strain used in this experiment was far lower, with a mean homozygosity across all bins of only 31% (Figure 3.3). This was a surprise, as it is an established strain that has been extant for decades, and we therefore expected the level of homozygosity to be commensurate with that observed in the Cab strain. An obvious exception is chr22, for which Kaga appears to be homozygous across its entire length.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Kaga F0 generation genome (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether the low levels of observed homozygosity in Kaga was affected by its alignments to the southern Japanese HdrR reference, we also aligned the F0 samples to the northern Japanese HNI reference (Figure 3.4). This did not make differences to the levels of observed homozygosity in either sample, which gave us confidence that the low homozygosity observed in Kaga was not driven by reference bias. I understand from our collaborators that the low homozygosity of this Kaga individual must have resulted from the strain having been contaminated at some stage by breeding with a different inbred strain prior to when they received the individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the Kaga F0 generation genome when aligned to the HNI reference (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanecek, Petr, James K Bonfield, Jennifer Liddle, John Marshall, Valeriu Ohan, Martin O Pollard, Andrew Whitwham, et al. 2021. “Twelve Years of SAMtools and BCFtools.” GigaScience 10 (2): giab008. https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008.\n\n\nDePristo, Mark A., Eric Banks, Ryan Poplin, Kiran V.

Approximately half the chromosomes show inconsistent heterozygosity, with a mean heterozygosity across all bins of 67%.

The number of SNPs that met these criteria per chromosome are set out in Figure 4.2. The strong homozygosity of Kaga on chr22 is likely responsible for the much greater number of loci on that chromosome that can be used for calling genoytpes in the F2 generation, and highlights the importance of the parental strains being highly homozygous when used in experimental crosses such as this.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Number of SNPs per chromosome that were homozygous-divergent in the F0 Cab and Kaga generations, and heterozygous in the F1 generation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To maximise the efficiency of our sequencing runs, our collaborators “shallow-sequenced” the F2 generation with the short-read Illumina platform at a depth of ~1x. I then aligned these sequences to the HdrR reference with BWA-MEM2 (Vasimuddin et al. 2019), sorted the reads and marked duplicates with Picard (“Picard Toolkit” 2019), then indexed the resulting BAM files with SAMtools (Danecek et al. 2021). Genotyping these shallow sequences with the same method as used for the high-coverage sequences for the F0 and F1 generation would be inappropriate. We therefore used a different method whereby we used bam-readcount (Khanna et al. 2022) to count the reads that supported either the Cab or the Kaga allele for all SNPs that met the criteria described above in section @f1-heterozygosity above, summed the read counts within 5 kb blocks, and calculated the frequency of reads within each bin that supported the Kaga allele. This generated a value for each bin between 0 and 1, where 0 signified that all reads within that bin supported the Cab allele, and 1 signified that all reads within that bin supported the Kaga allele. Bins containing no reads were imputed with a value of 0.5.\nI then used these values for all F2 individuals as the input to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with the software package hmmlearn (Hmmlearn/Hmmlearn [2014] 2022), which I applied to classify each bin as one of three states, with state 0 corresponding to homozygous-Cab, 1 corresponding to heterozygous, and 2 corresponding to homozygous-Kaga. Across each chromosome of every sample, the output of the HMM was expected to produce a sequence of states. Based on previous biological knowledge that crossover events occur on average less than once per chromosome (Haenel et al. 2018) (see Figure 5.1 for the average crossover rates per chromosome in zebrafish), I expected to observe the same state persisting for long stretches of the chromosome, only changing to another state between 0 and 3 times, and rarely more. To achieve this, I adjusted the HMM’s transition probabilities to be extremely low, and the Gaussian emission probabilities for each state to have a variance of 0.8, which resulted in long “blocks” of the same genotype call across the chromosome with only a small number of average transitions (i.e. crossover events) per chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Crossovers per chromosome based on data provided in Haenel et al. (2018), where “crossovers per chromosome” for each chromosome \\(c\\) was calculated by \\(\\frac{crossover~rate_{c}(cM / Mb) \\times length_{c}(Mb)} {100}\\). The medaka genome is shorter in length than the zebrafish genome (~800 Mb compared to ~1,300 Mb), which according to the authors would suggest that medaka likely has a higher average crossover rate than what is presented in this figure.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows how adjusting the HMM parameters changed the called genotypes for 10 F2 samples on chromosome 18, by way of an example. Allowing the HMM to train itself for the transition probabilities and emission variances, the HMM produced an apparently noisy output (A). Fixing the transition probabilities to make it very likely for a state to transition back to itself rather than to another state did not appear to change the output (B). However, increasing the Gaussian emission variances created the “blocks” that I expected, and the higher the emission variances, the “tighter” the blocks (C-F).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: HMM states called for each bin across chr18 for 10 F2 samples, to illustrate the effect of changing the HMM’s transition probabilities and emission variances. States 0, 1, and 2 correspond to homozygous Cab, heterozygous, and homozygous Kaga. Each point represents a 5-kb bin. Y-axis is the proportion of reads within each bin that align to the Kaga allele. X-axis is the bp location of the start of each bin. A: Standard HMM with all model parameters trained on the data. B. HMM with fixed transition probabilities of 0 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0 or 1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1 or 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2 = 0.999; 0 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1 or 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1 = 0.00066; 0 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2 or 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0 = 0.000333; 1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0 or 1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2 = 0.0005. C-F retain those transition probabilities but with different fixed emission variances of 0.01 (C), 0.33 (D), 0.8 (E), and 1 (F).\n\n\n\n\nI used these genotype-block calls to generate the recombination karyoplot shown in Figure 5.3, with homozygous-Cab blocks in green, heterozoygous blocks in navy blue, and homozygous Kaga blocks in red. Missing calls are blank, where the vertical blank lines indicate that the region could not be called for any F2 individuals, likely due to an insufficient number of informative SNPs residing in those 5-kb blocks; and horizontal blank lines indicate that the sample could not be called, likely due to low sequencing coverage for that sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Recombination blocks in 622 F2 samples based on the ratio of reads mapping to either the Cab or Kaga allele within 5-kb bins, with homozygous-Cab blocks in green, heterozoygous blocks in navy blue, and homozygous Kaga blocks in red. Most blocks show 0-2 crossover events, as expected, with some regions showing higher numbers of crossovers interpreted as noise. Unfilled regions are those with no state called by the HMM due to a lack of reads mapping to SNPs within those 5-kb bins.\n\n\n\n\nIn the downstream analysis, I excluded the 22 samples that showed poor coverage across the genome. For the remaining samples, I “filled” the bins with missing genotypes based on the call of the previous called bin, or if unavailable (e.g. the missing bin was at the start of the chromosome), then the next called bin (Figure 5.4); note that this figure retains the low-coverage samples (horizontal blank lines) that were excluded from further analysis to allow for a direct comparison with Figure 5.3. I used these filled genotype calls for the association tests described below in section (somite-assoc-tests?). As a rough way to estimate the accuracy of this genotyping method, we checked the genotypes called by the HMM for the reporter region on chr16 ~28.7Mb against our collaborators’ manual recording of reporter gene counts based on the intensity of the Her7-Venus reporter’s fluorescence. The confusion matrix is set out in Table 5.1, showing that 83% of genotypes called by the HMM were consistent with the reporter genotypes as inferred from fluorescence brightness.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1:  Confusion matrix for reporter genotype as called by the HMM, and as inferred from the fluorescence brightness. \n \n  \n    HMM state \n    Reporter phenotype \n    Count \n  \n \n\n  \n    0 \n    0 \n    252 \n  \n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    91 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    245 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese karyoplots show interesting recombination patterns for several chromosomes. Given the F2 individuals were selected for the reporter gene on chr16, as expected, there appears to be a strong strong skew towards those genotypes across the whole chromosome. On chr3, most samples are homozygous-Cab for the second half of the chromosome, with a consistent breakpoint around ~22 Mb. However, the final fifth of samples which show a different recombination pattern. The samples are sorted based on the order that they were phenotyped and sequenced, so this difference could have been caused by their being generated from different F1 individuals with distinct haplotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Recombination blocks in 622 F2 samples based on the ratio of reads mapping to either the Cab or Kaga allele within 5-kb bins, with homozygous-Cab blocks in green, heterozoygous blocks in navy blue, and homozygous Kaga blocks in red. Most blocks show 0-2 crossover events, as expected, with some regions showing higher numbers of crossovers interpreted as noise. Bins with missing genotypes were “filled” based on the call of the previous called bin, or if unavailable (e.g. the missing bin was at the start of the chromosome), then the next called bin.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5 shows the proportion of 5-kb bins called as either homozygous-Cab, heterozygous, or homozygous-Kaga within each F2 sample (points). The ordinary expectation for the ratios would be 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25 respectively. However, we observe a skew towards homozygous-Cab and away from homozygous Kaga. This was likely caused by the hybrid incompatibility between Cab and Kaga, given the two strains were derived from populations that are thought to be at the point of speciation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Proportions of 5-kb blocks called as either homozygous-Cab, heterozygous, or homozygous-Kaga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanecek, Petr, James K Bonfield, Jennifer Liddle, John Marshall, Valeriu Ohan, Martin O Pollard, Andrew Whitwham, et al. 2021. “Twelve Years of SAMtools and BCFtools.” GigaScience 10 (2): giab008. https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008.\n\n\nHaenel, Quiterie, Telma G.

The mespb (ENSORLG00000014656) and pcdh10b (ENSORLG00000020474) genes have both been found to be involved in segmental boundary formation and somite patterning (Hitachi et al. 2008; Rangarajan, Luo, and Sargent 2006), and are highly conserved in vertebrates (Gul et al. 2017; Satou, Imai, and Satoh 2004). Preliminary results have shown that knocking out either of these genes from the Cab strain significantly speeds up somite period development by 2-3 minutes (Figure 6.3)), providing promising evidence that these genes are involved in the establishment of the segmentation clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Period intercept for Cab embryos with CRISPR-Cas9 knock-outs (Campenhout et al. 2019) of mespb and pcdh10b compared to controls.

    "text": "6.2 PSM area\nFigure 6.4 is a Manhattan plot of the genetic linkage results for the PSM area phenotype. The regions found to be significant based on the permutations’ minimum \\(p\\)-value are set out in Table 6.4, although they exceed the Bonferroni correction threshold as well. I note that this ~6 Mb significant region on chromosome 3 does not overlap at all with the significant region discovered for the period intercept phenotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Manhattan plot of the genetic linkage results for the PSM area phenotype.

I ran Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor (McLaren et al. 2016) over these SNPs to identify those that would be most likely to have functional consequences. The full counts of SNPs falling into each category of ‘consequence’ are set out in Table 6.5. From this process I identified 114 genes that included a missense variant, and 1 that included a both a missense variant and a start lost (ENSORLG00000010863, a centriole, cilia and spindle-associated protein).\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.5:  Variant Effect Predictor results for SNPs in the bins. \n \n  \n    Consequence \n    Count \n  \n \n\n  \n    intron variant \n    47211 \n  \n  \n    intergenic variant \n    20045 \n  \n  \n    upstream gene variant \n    7304 \n  \n  \n    downstream gene variant \n    5229 \n  \n  \n    3 prime UTR variant \n    1082 \n  \n  \n    synonymous variant \n    694 \n  \n  \n    missense variant \n    383 \n  \n  \n    5 prime UTR variant \n    201 \n  \n  \n    splice region variant,intron variant \n    126 \n  \n  \n    missense variant,splice region variant \n    19 \n  \n  \n    splice region variant,synonymous variant \n    17 \n  \n  \n    stop gained \n    3 \n  \n  \n    splice donor variant \n    1 \n  \n  \n    start lost \n    1 \n  \n  \n    stop lost \n    1 \n  \n  \n    stop lost,splice region variant \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur collaborators then combined these results with bulk RNA-seq that they had performed on F0 Cab and Kaga individuals, to determine which of these genes are expressed in the unsegmented tail during embryogenesis. This allowed them to reduce to the list to 96 genes, although they were not apparently associated with a specific gene ontology as perhaps expected, given this is a single locus that is potentially driven by just one gene. As with the period intercept phenotype, our collaborators are now in the process of knocking in the Cab allele into Kaga embryos, and vice versa, to functionally validate these variants.\n\n\n\n\nCampenhout, Claude Van, Pauline Cabochette, Anne-Clémence Veillard, Miklos Laczik, Agnieszka Zelisko-Schmidt, Céline Sabatel, Maxime Dhainaut, Benoit Vanhollebeke, Cyril Gueydan, and Véronique Kruys. 2019. “Guidelines for Optimized Gene Knockout Using CRISPR/Cas9.” BioTechniques 66 (6): 295–302. https://doi.org/10.2144/btn-2018-0187.\n\n\nGul, Ismail Sahin, Paco Hulpiau, Yvan Saeys, and Frans van Roy. 2017. “Evolution and Diversity of Cadherins and Catenins.” Experimental Cell Research, Cell Sensing and Signaling via Cell-Cell Adhesion, 358 (1): 3–9. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.03.001.\n\n\nHitachi, Keisuke, Hiroki Danno, Akiko Kondow, Kiyoshi Ohnuma, Hideho Uchiyama, Shoichi Ishiura, Akira Kurisaki, and Makoto Asashima. 2008. “Physical Interaction Between Tbx6 and Mespb Is Indispensable for the Activation of Bowline Expression During Xenopus Somitogenesis.” Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 372 (4): 607–12. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.05.083.\n\n\nMcLaren, William, Laurent Gil, Sarah E.
