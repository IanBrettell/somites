## F~0~ coverage

Our collaborators extracted DNA from the F~0~, F~1~, and F~2~, and sequenced the F~0~ and F~1~ samples with the Illumina platform at high coverage (~26x for *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* and ~29x for *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`*), as measured by *SAMtools* [@danecekTwelveYearsSAMtools2021]. **@fig-F0-coverage** sets out the mean sequencing depth within each chromosome and across the whole genome for the *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* and *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* F~0~ samples. Our collaborators then sequenced the F~2~ samples at low coverage (~1x), which would be sufficient to map their genotypes back to the genotypes of their parental strains (see section \@ref(somite-f2-sequencing) below for further details).

## F~0~ homozygosity

Before proceeding to map the F~2~ sequences to the genotypes of the F~0~ generation, I first investigated the levels of homozygosity in the F~0~ *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* and *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* strains, as this would affect our ability to accurately call the F~2~ generation. That is to say, for regions where either F~0~ parent is consistently heterozygous, it would be difficult to determine the parent from which a particular F~2~ individual derived its chromosomes at that locus. I therefore aligned the high-coverage sequencing data for the F~0~ *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* and *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* strains to the medaka *HdrR* reference (Ensembl release 104, build ASM223467v1) using *BWA-MEM2* [@vasimuddinEfficientArchitectureawareAcceleration2019], sorted the aligned .sam files, marked duplicate reads, and merged the paired reads with picard [@Picard2019toolkit], and indexed the .bam files with *SAMtools* [@liSequenceAlignmentMap2009]. 

To call variants, I followed the GATK best practices (to the extent they were applicable) [@mckennaGenomeAnalysisToolkit2010; @depristoFrameworkVariationDiscovery2011; @vanderauweraGenomicsCloudUsing2020] with GATK's HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs tools [@poplinScalingAccurateGenetic2018], then merged all calls into a single .vcf file with picard [@Picard2019toolkit]. Finally, I extracted the biallelic calls for *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* and *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* with bcftools [@danecekTwelveYearsSAMtools2021], counted the number of SNPs within non-overlapping, 5-kb bins, and calculated the proportion of SNPs within each bin that were homozgyous. 

**fig-somite-f0-cab** is a circos plot generated with circlize [@guCirclizeImplementsEnhances2014] for the *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* F~0~ strain used in this experiment, featuring the proportion of homozygous SNPs per 5-kb bin (green), and the total number of SNPs in each bin (yellow). As expected for a strain that has been inbred for over 10 generations, the mean homozygosity for this strain is high, with a mean proportion of homozygosity across all bins of 83%.

```{r}

#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 7

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/plots/circos/trio_homo/hdrr/5000/Cab.png"), auto_pdf = T)
```

However, the levels of homozygosity in the *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* strain used in this experiment was far lower, with a mean homozygosity across all bins of only 31% (**@fig-somite-f0-kaga**). This was a surprise, as it is an established strain that has been extant for decades, and we therefore expected the level of homozygosity to be commensurate with that observed in the *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* strain. An obvious exception is chr22, for which *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* appears to be homozygous across its entire length.

```{r}
#| label: fig-somite-f0-kaga
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: 'Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the *Kaga* F~0~ generation genome (*red*), and number of SNPs in each bin (*yellow*).'
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/plots/circos/trio_homo/hdrr/5000/Kaga.png"), auto_pdf = T)
```

To determine whether the low levels of observed homozygosity in *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* was affected by its alignments to the southern Japanese *HdrR* reference, we also aligned the F~0~ samples to the northern Japanese *HNI* reference (**@fig-somite-f0-kaga-hni**). This did not make differences to the levels of observed homozygosity in either sample, which gave us confidence that the low homozygosity observed in *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* was not driven by reference bias. I understand from our collaborators that the low homozygosity of this *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* individual must have resulted from the strain having been contaminated at some stage by breeding with a different inbred strain prior to when they received the individuals.
