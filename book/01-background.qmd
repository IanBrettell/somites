# Background

Somites are the earliest primitive segmental structures that form from presomatic mesoderm cells (**PSM**) in the embryo [@kimPeriodSomiteSegmentation2011], later differentiating into vertebrae, ribs, and skeletal muscles. Somite formation occurs rhythmically and sequentially, with the time between the formation of each pair of somites referred to as the "period". The period of somite formation varies greatly between species [@matsudaSpeciesspecificSegmentationClock2020], and is controlled by a molecular oscillator, known as the 'segmentation clock', which drives waves of gene expression in developmental pathways. 

It is not fully understood how the phase waves of the segmentation clock are initially established [@falkImagingOnsetOscillatory2022]. To identify the genetic basis of these phase waves, our collaborators Ali Seleit and Alexander Aulehla at EMBL-Heidelberg used a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in approach [@seleitEndogenousProteinTagging2021] to establish a medaka *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* strain with an endogenous, fluorescing reporter gene (Her7-Venus) for the oscillation signalling pathway. This method allows them to image somite formation and extract quantitative measures for segmentation clock dynamics. They determined that the southern Japanese *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`* strain and the northern Japanese *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`* strain have divergent somite periodicity, where *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Kaga", color = "#DE3C4B")`*'s tends to be faster, and *`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cab", color = "#43AA8B")`*'s slower (**@fig-ali-f0-period**), and selected them as the parental strains in an F~2~-cross. This chapter sets out my bioinformatic contributions to the project by identifying the genetic variations associated with differences in somite periodicity.
