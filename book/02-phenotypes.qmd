# Phenotypes of interest {#somite-phenotype}

## Somite development period

**@fig-ali-somite-period-lines** shows the period data generated by pyBOAT for this study, for 100 illustrative F~2~ samples over 300 minutes. The same data can be represented by boxplots as shown in **@fig-ali-somite-period-box**. I experimented with using the F~2~ individuals' mean period and period intercept as the phenotype of interest. The two measures are highly correlated ($Pearson's~r =$ 0.84, $p$ < 2.2 x 10^-16^), so after displaying the distributions for both measures in @fig-somite-phenos, I proceed to only discuss the analysis of period intercept, as it would appear to potentially be more robust to the changes in slope that can be observed in @fig-ali-somite-period-lines.

## Unsegmented presomitic mesoderm area (PSM)

In the proceeding analyses, I also included a second phenotype of interest: the total area of the unsegmented tissue at the stage where 10-11 somites had been formed (**PSM area**). As the measure is simply based on the total number of pixels covered by the embryo object, I considered it to be potentially more robust than the period measurements, and therefore included it as a type of positive control for the genetic association analyses on the period phenotype. The measurements for PSM area comparing F~0~ *Cab* and *Kaga* strains are shown in **@fig-ali-psm-f0**.

## Comparisons between F~0~, F~1~ and F~2~ generations

**@fig-somite-phenos** shows the distributions of the period intercept and unsegmented PSM area phenotypes across the F~0~, F~1~ and F~2~ generations. In relation to the period intercept phenotype, only the *Cab* strain in shown for F~0~ because only the *Cab* strain carries the reporter gene, which prohibited the collection of data for *Kaga* using this pyBOAT method. However, from previous bright field image analyses (which did not require the reporter), my collaborators determined that the *Kaga* strain has a lower (i.e. faster) period than *Cab* by around 10 minutes (see Figure \@ref(fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR) in the Introduction). Given these differences, the F~1~ generation shows the expected intermediate median between the *Cab* and *Kaga* F~0~ strains. I also expected to observe that the F~2~ generation has a similar median to the F~1~ generation, but with a wider variance that spans across the extremes of the two F~0~ parental strains. Instead, I observed that the F~2~ generation has a median that is slightly *slower* than the median of the slower-period F~0~ *Cab* strain. My collaborators assured me that these observations were unlikely to be caused by technical issues. A possible biological explanation of this is that there are more genetic combinations that slow down the clock rather than speed it up [@sanchezArnoldTongueEntrainment2022; @schroterSegmentNumberAxial2010]. This phenomenon could be exacerbated by the fact that the *Cab* and *Kaga* strains originate from different Japanese medaka populations (southern and northern respectively), which are understood to be at the point of speciation (see Chapter \@ref(MIKK-genomes-chap)), so this slower period may be driven by a biological incompatibility between their genomes in cases where they do not have a complete chromosome from each parent (as the F~1~ generation does). I nevertheless proceeded with the genetic analysis with a view to potentially discovering the reason for this unusual distribution.

```{r}
#| label: fig-somite-phenos
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Comparisons between the F~0~, F~1~ and F~2~ generations for period intercept and unsegmented PSM area. As only the *Cab* strain contains the reporter gene, the F~0~ only shows period intercept for *Cab* individuals (with the *Kaga* strain previously estimated to have a period of ~10 minutes slower than *Cab*). **A**: period intercept in minutes. **B**: unsegmented PSM area in pixels. $P$-values are derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing the F~2~ individuals across microscopes. For unsegmented PSM area, data was only collected for the F~2~ generation."

```

Another important issue to note is that the F~2~ individuals were sequenced using different microscopes of the same model (Zeiss LSM 780) but with different temperature control units and incubator boxes, denoted as 'AU' and 'DB'.^['AU' for the Aulehla Lab microscope, and 'DB' for  EMBL-Heidelberg's Developmental Biology Unit microscope.] Our collaborators noticed that there was a difference between the microscopes in their temperatures of 0.7-0.8Â°C, translating to a 4-minute difference in the F~2~ means for the period intercept measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 177.97, $p$ = 1.34 x 10^-40^), and a 3.5-minute difference in the F~2~ means for the period mean measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 141.79, $p$ = 1.08 x 10^-32^). This difference would need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis through either adjusting the phenotype prior to running the genetic association model, or by including microscope as a covariate in the model. For unsegmentated PSM area, I did not find a significant difference between microscopes, so I determined that it was not necessary to control for microscope in the downstream analysis for this phenotype.

#### Inverse-normalisation {#inverse-norm-sec}

To resolve this difference between microscopes for the period intercept data, I elected to transform it for the F~2~ generation by "inverse-normalising" the period intercept within each microscope (**Figure \@ref(fig:invnorm-intercept)**), and used this transformed phenotype for the downstream analysis. Inverse-normalisation is a rank-based normalisation approach which involves replacing the values in the phenotype vector with their rank (where ties are averaged), then converting the ranks into a normal distribution with the quantile function [@wichuraAlgorithm241Percentage1988]. The inverse-normalisation function I used for this analysis is set out in the following `R` code:
